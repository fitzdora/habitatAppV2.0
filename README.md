#Isadora Fitzgerald 20099887 - Assignment 2 Mobile App Development

##Brief - Continue working on your own app, exhibiting a similar level of complexity/feature density as covered in the Case Study throughout the remainder of the Semester

##Proposal - I continued to work with my educational app - myHabitat -basically an app that helps you map flora and fauna in your immediate areaâ€¦ideally the end product is that you take a photo that sets the location and maps for you using the camera location metadata and stores it so you can later identify the species.

##Personal Statement
I was not sure if we were to start again as the case study and methodology was very different from the first semester so I begun again from scratch based on my original idea but using the Jetpack and MVVM method as I thought from the labs up to week 10 I could manage it. 
This I now know to have been a huge time wasting mistake and I have hit nothing but roadblocks trying to work out its development.
Where at the end of Assignment one I had full confidence in my ability this has now been dissipated as I struggle to get even the basic CRUD and Images working off the ground.
From the Lab the build looked easy but it was not clear to me if we could just add a Nav Drawer onto the assignment one build and I spent a long time trying to work this out that ate into my starting the second assignment.
As it stood I could not even finish Week 11 or Week 12 of the Semester work as I realised had left it too late to begin, and I think I had already began on a mistake. 
I basically soldiered on knowing all the time I was digging my own pit!

###I know have a host of errors:

###1. Namely I cannot load the specieslist at all so I cannot check if the specieslist is loading
###2. Before this I was unable to get the imageIcon on the Specieslist to load
###3. I had not even reached trying to update on the SpeciesDetailFragment
###4. Basically I now have less of an understanding on how fragments work as I have missed something fundamental along the way and it is really too late.

I would have been better off staying with assignment one and trying to work on how to get the Camera Intent working I jumped before I could leap!
